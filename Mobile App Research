The future of innovation and advancements in mobile technology

Nowadays, mobile technology has developed a long way over the past decade as we can see for example from our mobile device. They were developing in many aspects since from the first day debut such as shape, size, capacity, style, appearance, feature, image/camera technology, artificial intelligence, processors, and function etc. Those all-integrated features will make our lives easier [3]. The significant changes are that the function and communication. The role of phone has changed since they can just only make calls.

The generation of technology has been developing every decade, 5G technology is present use of mobile connectivity [1]. However, in 2030, 6G technology would be expected to be released for mobile devices around the world, which will support complexity devices. Nonetheless, itâ€™s true to say that Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays an important role in the present and will be more capability in the next decade, the artificial intelligence of the future can make a complexity including making decisions like humans. It could be the center of smart devices such as entertainment, cars connection even more home automation systems, making restaurant reservations and other things that humans can do in daily life.

Trending in the mobile tech industry is constantly developing due to the advancement of technology.

While some roles may become obsolete, for example, basic mobile phone repair, legacy mobile skills, manual testing, some mobile hardware manufacturing. However, job relevance can vary rapidly because of tech dynamics. Professionals in this field should learn and update new knowledge and skills that are continuously developed for up-to-date knowledge to adapt to job requirements.
